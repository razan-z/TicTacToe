## 🧠 How It Works

- The board is a 3×3 grid managed as a 2D array.
- Players take turns clicking cells to place their symbol (X or O).
- The app checks for a winner after each move using predefined winning combinations.
- When a winner is found or all cells are filled, the game ends.
- The game can be reset at any time using the reset button.
